# Coding-Quiz

Module 4 challenge repo

## Description

This challenge required me to create a coding quiz to test my knowedge of javascript. I had to create a multi-question quiz that included a timer element from scratch. When you answer a question incorrectly, you lose 5 seconds off of your overall time which equates to your final score. Good luck!
